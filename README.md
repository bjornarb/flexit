Flexit
======

Flexit is a small set of CSS classes for rapidly creating fixed height application layouts using CSS Flexbox.

If you want to use Flexit in production you need to consider browser support. CSS Flexbox is currently supported by the latest releases of all major browsers. For support in previous releases see: http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox

##Usage
Flexit is intended for fixed height application layouts. If you are using it for a full screen application you need to set the height of the html and body tag to 100% by adding the class .hf to both. Flexit can also be used inside a single container, but it needs a fixed height.

Flexit has 2 container classes, .hbox will stack its children horizontally and .vbox vertically. Additional classes will add gap between children, padding, scrolling and center them horizontally or vertically (omg!). You can add the .flex class to containers that you want to grow to fill available space in the parent container.

```html
<!-- Set html to full height -->
<html class="hf">
  <!-- Set body to full height and stack children vertically -->
  <body class="hf vbox">
    <div>Header</div>
    <!-- Stack children horizontally, add gap between children, flex to push footer to the bottom of the page -->
    <div class="hbox hg4 flex">
      <div>Left column</div>
      <!-- Make right column take up available horizontal space, scroll if content overflows -->
      <div class="flex scroll">Right column</div>
    </div>
    <div>Footer</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Example
The example below (example.html) is created with Flexit. The body element has a .debug class that adds background color and border to all children to make it easier to debug your layout.

##Inspiration
Flexit is inspired the HBox and VBox containers in Adobe Flex (AS3) and OOCSS.
